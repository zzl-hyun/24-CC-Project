      "reason": "The current analysis shows ambiguity and caution is advised. Market sentiment remains in 'Extreme Greed', often a precursor to corrections. The recent rise in the Fear and Greed Index reflects heightened market euphoria, which can be volatile. Technical indicators show mixed signals with potential resistance at current levels around 123,724,000 KRW. The current BTC/ KRW price is near the SMA and EMA convergence, suggesting a lack of clear trend direction. No Bitcoin holdings are in the portfolio, and the cash position remains liquid, allowing flexibility once clearer signals emerge. Given these factors, a hold decision is recommended to preserve capital and await more decisive market movements.",
